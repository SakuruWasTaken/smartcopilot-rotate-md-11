# smartcopilot-rotate-md-11
Smartcopilot Configuration for X-Plane 11 Aircraft MD-11 from Rotate

Works for both MD-11F and MD-11P v1.10-13

99% of things are working well, but keep an eye on the CDU. This config only syncs button inputs to the CDU and cannot sync the CDU state, so be careful and watch for desyncs

do not disable the option in settings "Inhibit accelerations in FGCP knobs", this WILL cause desync when turning these knobs

rarely, these knobs can become desynced anyways, if this happens, you can turn them until they reach the max value, then turn them back to the desired value

if something becomes desynced, you may need to disconnect, fix the issue, then reconnect. this is fine to do and should not cause problems
